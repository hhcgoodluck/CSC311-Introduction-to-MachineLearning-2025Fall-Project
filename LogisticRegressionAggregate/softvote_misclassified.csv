8,Claude,ChatGPT,754,"This tool is a language processing tool. It can be used to write letters or reports, brain storm ideas. It can also be process images or documents. I can summarize a document. You can even ask it specific questions related to a document. Such as to extract relevant data from the document that one is interested in. When i asked it to generate a image with five persons sometimes it generated with 6. It sometimes makes sign errors . I first ask it for references if it does not provide any. Sometimes is does not provide correct references. Then based on my needs and situation i fact check the relevant parts. If the answer involves any number or statistics i make doubly sure they are thoroughly checked as this tool often makes mistakes with numbers."
8,Gemini,ChatGPT,503,I would use it to it summarize a document i received in an email. it can be used to generate ideas and create reports or compose a formal letter. When asked to extract cost of a course from a website it did not account for the fact that the fees are paid for 2 years once each year and so it reported half the cost only. i fact check the sources it cites. But i often find that the sometimes the content if not from the sources it cites so i have to do additional fact checking by doing a search myself.
22,Claude,ChatGPT,378,"I don't like using [THIS MODEL] or similar tools, but I have used them for explaining errors in code that I half understand. When debugging code I have had it run in circles in desciribing what is wrong. It will say A is the problem, change it to B. This causes a new Issue C so it says change B to A. I check it against my own knowledge, google, or in code I just run the code."
22,Gemini,Claude,86,I have never used this model I have never used this model I have never used this model
25,Gemini,Claude,54,fixing code the model delete all the code run the code
50,Claude,Gemini,293,"Researching purchases as it has a larger context window than [ANOTHER MODEL] It is far worse than other models at reasoning, so it often gets confused explain math It mostly messes up logic so I look at it a validate the logic myself which negates a lot of the point of using it for some thing"
52,Claude,Gemini,747,"Summarizing long documents When I asked [THIS MODEL] to help debug a Python error trace involving NumPy, it gave me a very generalized explanation of possible causes. It listed several broad scenarios but didn’t directly point out the actual mistake in my code. It also avoided suggesting a concrete fix until I provided more clarifying context. For math or statistics tasks, I would do the calculation myself, compare with course materials, or confirm in Office Hours. For coding, I would trace the code, run it in my IDE, and test edge cases to ensure the solution works. For factual or research-based questions, I would cross-check against lecture notes, textbooks, or other reliable sources, since [THIS MODEL] often summarizes without citing."
59,ChatGPT,Gemini,553,I would use [THIS MODEL] to get informations about random general knowledge information. Also I feel like this model is very good at explaining difficult scientific notions making them very simple and concrete. I used [THIS MODEL] to help me prepare for my math tests. It was sometimes giving me very wrong answers. The worst part was when I asked him Logic answers. [THIS MODEL] simply cant proof things that are not already online. I found it suboptimal because it was giving wrong answers. I search an article or something like this online by myself.
59,Gemini,Claude,330,"I never use [THIS MODEL]. I heard it was good at everything. Also, his API is better. I would use it to call its API for a project. I heard using [THIS MODEL] without its API calls straight in the code is not very clear when he answers questions. I would also check online for information or debug the code if this is I asked for."
60,Claude,Gemini,156,For coming up with writing ideas I asked it a question and it gave me some false information I would look up the facts that it gives me and try to verify it
60,Gemini,ChatGPT,274,"Explaining concepts I asked about programming and it gave me an answer that was a bit buggy I would find the references it gives and look through it quickly to verify the information it gives me. If none are given, I’d do a quick search to convince myself the answer is true"
64,Claude,Gemini,157,Brainstorming and research The code provided makes small errors which causes the program to not work as intended. Check online and look for credible sources.
67,Claude,ChatGPT,736,"I would use this model for coding, since I can connect it directly to my GitHub account and import repositories into its context. I’d also use it for reading through long documents and answering questions about them, as it handles large amounts of text well. For the Math Question: Susan and Lisa decided to play tennis against each other. They bet $1 on each game they played. Susan won three bets and Lisa won $5. How many games did they play? This model gave an incorrect answer of 8 games when the answer should be 11 games. I mostly use this model for debugging or creating small utility scripts. So I usually just glance at the code to see if it isn't doing anything malicious and then run to see if the output is what I expected."
67,Gemini,ChatGPT,631,"I would use this model to polish my responses for STAR interview questions, since its writing style feels less “AI-like” to me. I also use it for tasks that involve Google Suite, like Drive and Docs, because it integrates easily and helps streamline my workflow. When I asked this model a graph-related question, it first used an incorrect algorithm and misunderstood the problem. I had to provide additional prompts for it to grasp the question, unlike with the other models. I’d check the model’s answer by comparing it with reliable resources. Even if it gives sources, I’d make sure the answer actually matches and makes sense."
68,Gemini,Claude,276,"I have never used [THIS MODEL] before, but I might use it for coding. Maybe also writing essays / emails. I'll compare it with [ANOTHER MODEL]'s response and use the better one. Google it to see if it's true or ask [ANOTHER MODEL] to verify if it's too long for Google search."
70,Claude,Gemini,186,"Writing, summarizing, editing, analysis In writing code, will make simple mistakes or memory issues. Analyze the response myself, google search, run and test the code if that is the task"
70,Gemini,Claude,234,"quick summaries, compiling references, coding, verifying my own answers. When wanting a summary, it often gets facts wrongs or makes them up if it doesn’t know. Looking through the references it provided, to see if conclusion is true."
74,Claude,Gemini,869,"I would use this model for vibe coding tasks, prototyping projects, and to seek advice on life and the world. I prefer to use it for tasks that are more autonomous than other models. I have found the model's responses for math computations suboptimal due to its suboptimal use of LaTeX in responses. The responses wind up being harder to read and less useful for learning when the core logic is stuck behind obtuse formatting, and I find myself reaching for other models in this case. My verification of this model's responses, due to my use being majority for coding tasks, would be done by simply trying out the code. If it's for a one-off project, I don't really care to verify its output exactly, as long as it works well enough, but if I was using it in a more focused environment, I'd try to write tests and verify the code just as I would any human-written code."
79,Gemini,ChatGPT,315,"General questions Have only used this model to try to build chatbots. When querying it as a chatbot, it often did not give the information that was asked for or could not accurately locate the information. When used for chatbots, I read through the response and checked if the information given is what I asked for."
96,Claude,ChatGPT,120,Math computations and debugging code Does not provide sufficiently creative ideas for brainstorming. Quick Google search
102,Claude,Gemini,128,"Never try this. not sure, sometimes use it but don't find any mistakes. only use this model rarely so never verify the response."
102,Gemini,Claude,228,"coding and debugging it is not that good at math computation as it sometimes gives a wrong answer even the question is not that complex. try to run the code and debug it by myself, because I usually use this model to write code."
105,Claude,ChatGPT,327,"I’d use it for long-form writing, summarizing articles, and getting clear explanations of complicated topics. When I asked it to debug Python, it explained in words but didn’t actually fix the bug, so I had to test and correct it myself I usually compare [THIS MODEL]’s explanation with a reliable source or ask [ANOTHER MODEL]"
105,Gemini,Claude,424,"I’d use it for quick factual lookups, summarizing news or trends, and multimodal tasks like interpreting or generating images/videos (Veo 3), similar to using Google but enhanced with AI. I asked it for a detailed essay draft, but the response felt generic and shallow compared to [ANOTHER MODEL] or [ANOTHER MODEL]. usually verify by cross-checking with Google search results, textbooks, or original references it provides."
108,ChatGPT,Gemini,356,"The unknown concepts and unfamiliar formulas of functions I will use [THIS MODEL] to help me. Because of the limited token, it's hard to generate such a long and detailed response to a math computation. Sometimes it works good at the beginning but at the end it looses accuracy. I would check it manually and then ask it again with my questions about that."
108,Gemini,Claude,298,"I use it to write or debug code, and raise exceptions for my code. Suboptimal response is in data processing or analysis, since it works better at coding, but worse at analysing. I will check first by myself, ask again with my questions about that, and then use other models to help me verify that."
121,ChatGPT,Claude,366,"For study purposes or use it like google. For study purposes, I tried a question on tutorial but would like AI to explain me the tutorial answer. For example math problem, some details will be missed or miscalculate causing a bad following response. I first have a basic idea in my mind for one question and ask it. When idea not in the same line, I question or ask."
126,ChatGPT,Gemini,584,"I would use the model for short, quick answers, or if I need pointers in a subject area that I'm not familiar with. The response was for a linear regression derivation task. The response was correct, but the derivation process in terms of algebraic expressions was complicated, difficult to parse, and not very intuitive. If the language model provided a link reference, I would follow the link to check for hallucinations. For technical questions, I use stack overflow or official documentation to verify the answer. Otherwise, I would perform a google search with relevant keywords."
129,Claude,ChatGPT,319,"Asking questions in a conversational tone, generating emails and texts, and generating ideas. It doesn't provide sources or examples for questions as it doesn't have access to the internet and it tends to make up information. Ask another generative AI model or google the prompt and see if there are sources that agree."
129,Gemini,ChatGPT,292,"Generating mathematical proofs, asking for sources relating to a topic, and solving complex integrals. [THIS MODEL] struggles with conversational responses. Its responses are often stiff and clearly robotic. Clicking on a source it provides or verifying numerical answers using wolfram alpha."
135,Claude,Gemini,349,"I used [THIS MODEL] to answer questions about general problems I face and explanations of idioms and such. Writing code with [THIS MODEL] is less optimal than the other models, as it is less details and usually doesn't offer an explanation for its approaches unless asked for. Compare with responses from other models and check with Google searches."
135,Gemini,Claude,517,"I also use [THIS MODEL] for math computation and coding. In my experience, it provides also better quality citations and resources for research. The main instances of [THIS MODEL] providing a suboptimal response is when again computing math and manipulating formulas/proofs. It brute forces the final result even though it didn't get there through the steps. Compare with [ANOTHER MODEL]/Deepseek, Google search, and match with the lecture slides that I am studying if I am currently trying to summarize the material."
157,Claude,Gemini,496,"Personally, I could use this for writing drafts of research documents. Also, I could ask [THIS MODEL] to create routine planners/guides. In math computations, sometimes [THIS MODEL] can make simple arithmetic errors especially when dealing with multi-step calculations paired with step-by-step explanations. This model would list the sources it uses to generate a response at the top, so verifying them is rather easy. Just go through the given sources and determine if they seem credible to you."
164,Gemini,Claude,130,Write coding homework They wrote essays with very professional tone that are very likely to be detected. Read the essay thoroughly
176,Gemini,Claude,215,Understanding concepts and asking for explanations. Asking questions about a particular topic. Revising an essay I have already written to be more clearer. Never used [THIS MODEL] before Never used this model before
177,ChatGPT,Gemini,701,"I use [THIS MODEL] to answer quick day-to-day questions about how to do things, as well as facts I want a quick answer to. I'd rarely use it for academic in the context of answering a whole question or assignment, but I use if for checking answers and studying. I asked [THIS MODEL] to give me a simple care guide for a rubber plant I have in my room and specifically asked it how often i should water it. It did provide a long guide on plant care but didn't mention how often i should water it. If its something to do with math or CS I usually cross reference with other solutions from people, GenAIs, and myself. I also try to work through the solution [THIS MODEL] provides on my own to find flaws."
185,Claude,Gemini,502,"I would use it mainly for administration stuff, like to create simple graphs quickly or for creating schedules. When I want it to write or debug my code, it does the job but I have to prompt it some more in order to get an explanation of what it fixed or created. I would search various websites with the same information and check if [THIS MODEL]'s response is correct. If the model is creating something more subjective like a schedule, I would manually go through it to see if it's what I asked for."
186,Claude,Gemini,227,"I use it to help me read articles and give me summaries I think this model often times give too much explanation, which I don't need, thus I don't use this model for explanation needs. I read some parts of the article by myself"
187,Claude,ChatGPT,325,"I use this model for mainly writing purposes, such as polishing emails, drafting, reviewing and editing my writing, etc. I sometimes use it for coding as well. I may ask the model for edits or to tighten up a piece of writing, but the output the model gave feels worse than the input. Clicking that link and seeing the source"
188,ChatGPT,Claude,749,"I would use [THIS MODEL] to explain concepts and ask for concept clarifications. Whenever there are abstract concepts that are mentioned in lecture, I would ask [THIS MODEL] to give some instantiations for me to more thoroughly understand the subject matter. I have asked this model to solve linear algebra problems. In displaying the solutions, [THIS MODEL] made simple and obvious computational mistakes in calculating normal vectors. In some cases, it messes up the signs and in other cases it misses fundamental multiplication operations. I would search using the Google search engine. Since the search results typically incorporate an AI response from [ANOTHER MODEL], I would check the results from [THIS MODEL] with that from [ANOTHER MODEL]."
189,ChatGPT,Gemini,175,"best used for brainstorming, essay writing, drafting emails/letters when math was involved the model gave answers that did not make sense ask the model for the sources it used"
189,Claude,Gemini,130,"best used for math, computations, logical problems given math problems it also gave incorrect solutions ask for the models sources"
208,Gemini,ChatGPT,682,"I use Google [THIS MODEL] whenever I do a Google search, and I get back an ""AI Overview"" response. The main task I use it for is asking questions that I want to know the answer to. When I Google a question and the AI Overview box shows up, it often gives an incorrect answer or solution to my question. Since I am already on Google when the AI Overview box shows up, and since it often provides a response that includes references or supporting evidence, I make sure to visit each of those references to make sure the information indeed matches and that the references themselves are reliable. I would also just scroll down to see the links that were provided from my Google search."
234,Claude,Gemini,112,I'd use to to schedule my day. i've never used it before. Compare and cross check with reliable resources i have
242,Claude,Gemini,272,"I don't use this model much, but I would use it for academic questions When I ask it for new ideas for a project, it gives ideas that are very generic I would search up the same topic on Google, and use multiple sources to check if the information it provided was correct."
242,Gemini,ChatGPT,304,"I would use it for academic questions I asked it for help on how to code something for a Hackathon, and it gave code that didn't do exactly what I needed, even after I told it to change multiple times I would search up the same topic on Google, and see if its response was correct based on other sources."
245,ChatGPT,Claude,481,"programming simple tasks, or things that have already been done by others quickly translating ideas into code searching for quick answers that aren't too important asking questions that feel awkward when worded as a search prompt Generating code for a recent javascript framework that has gone through a major update. It keeps using outdated syntax even if I explicitly asked for new syntax. For programming only: actually running the code to see if it produces the correct results"
266,Claude,Gemini,460,"I have never used [THIS MODEL] before, but I tried it out with a couple of questions aboout makeup products for very specific skin types, and it was able to perform pretty well. I also used it to draft a study plan for me. I tried getting it to draft a study plan for me (currently 1pm) and it keeps starting the day from 9am. I prompted it 3 times to have the start time be now, and it said it understood but did not actually change the schedule. googling it."
